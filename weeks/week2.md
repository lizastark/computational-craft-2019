## Assignment
Pick sentence or passage from a story that you like (children’s storybooks work VERY well), a song, a poem, etc that you like. Illustrate part of that narrative using a parallel circuit with 3 LEDs and materials we discussed in class.

*Please focus on the construction and aesthetics.* Think about how you will use other materials to diffuse your LEDs. Ideally, I would like the circuit visible in your illustration. Consider how you can use the aesthetic properties of the materials to design a circuit that is fully integrated into the illustration – not just a circuit on the bottom with a piece of paper on top.

Post your documentation and bring your final product into class.

Here are a few examples from past classes:
These do not embed the circuit into the illustration, but are still very successful aesthetically:

These do embed the circuit into the illustration:
