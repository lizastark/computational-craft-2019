2. Get signed into [Slack](https://slack.com/signin). The workspace is *computational-craft*. You should have an invitation - email me if you can't find it. Read this [file](https://github.com/lizastark/computational-craft-2019/blob/master/how-to-document.md) about how to submit assignments.
3. Find a project that excites you and that uses the materials we looked at in class. You can use one from todayâ€™s class or find something new. You can also look through these resource pages for inspiration:

  - [Publications](https://github.com/lizastark/computational-craft-2019/blob/master/resources/publications.md)

4. Create a post on your blog or a google doc that includes, images, video, or other documentation of the project from #2. Write a brief paragraph explaining what it is about this project that intrigues you. Post it to the #week_1_assignment channel in Slack.
