The exchange wishes to emphasize the importance of physicality and quality workmanship in an increasingly digital world.

A swatch is a microcosm: a small insight into a much bigger picture. It is the tip of the ice-burg, and it holds a world of potential inside. In creating a new swatch we are simultaneously cataloging knowledge and developing skills.

### Part 1: Design and create a swatch.
Design a switch or a sensor. You can use any materials you like. Document it on the blog using the same format as the post you made in class:
- **Title.** Give it a name
- **Description.** What does this swatch do? How does it work?
- **Materials.** What materials are used? (cardstock, copper tape, conductive yarn, LEDs, etc)
- **Techniques.** How was this swatch constructed? (e.g. folding, sewing, knitting, soldering, etc)
- **References.** Where have you seen it before? What inspired you?

### Part 2: Make three more identical ones. 
You will give these to three classmates next class. (You will have 4 total swatches). They do not have to look exactly the same â€“ you can play with color and aesthetic properties.
