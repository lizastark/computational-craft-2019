## Slides + Notes
- [Week 4 Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LBjEvBG0YRKXFaQBNv8L1Cd6XK4oEhO8A-UHwbU3nDg/edit#slide=id.g4352b47cb5_0_0)

## Assignment
1. Build two “nodes”, one for a battery and the other for LEDs. Use a different substrate for each (e.g. paper, wood, fabric, ceramics, etc).
2. Use your zine to build three more connector tools to connect your “nodes.” They can be all the same or all different.
3. Design a tool you would like to have in this class. It can be completely fantastical or gravely functional or both. You do not have to make this – it is a brainstorming exercise.

Document and post your assignment. Bring your nodes and connectors to next class.
