This course is heavily based in materials. I will provide samples for you to experiment with, but you will be responsible for purchasing materials for individual projects. Look at the materials page for much more.

# Required
Please purchase the tools, materials, and hardware under "Required" ASAP and bring them to every class.

- Straight pins

## Materials
- Paper (range of weights, colors, textures, etc e.g. tracing, vellum, cardstock, etc.)
- Assortment of fabric (muslin or cotton is fine)
- Tape (single, double sided, and/or glue dots)
- Masking tape
- Clear nail polish
- Copper tape (1/8 - 1/4" width with conductive adhesive)
- Heat'N'Bond (you can buy in pairs and split [this](https://www.amazon.com/HeatnBond-UltraHold-Iron-Adhesive-Inches/dp/B000XAMYXI/ref=pd_sim_201_9?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B000XAMYXI&pd_rd_r=c55fdc10-a97d-11e8-ad5d-f9d1f1abea37&pd_rd_w=vlVlG&pd_rd_wg=oxF6Q&pf_rd_i=desktop-dp-sims&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_p=a180fdfb-b54e-4904-85ba-d852197d6c09&pf_rd_r=XJSN0ZZXMG8CXY91DRSG&pf_rd_s=desktop-dp-sims&pf_rd_t=40701&psc=1&refRID=XJSN0ZZXMG8CXY91DRSG))
- Fabric glue
- Thread
- [Beeswax](https://www.amazon.com/Dritz-3153-Beeswax-with-Holder/dp/B001UADAQK) (for threading conductive thread or you can get a regular needle threader)

## Hardware
- A variety of LEDs of your choosing. Keep aesthetics in mind and default to [diffused](https://learn.adafruit.com/all-about-leds/what-are-leds-used-for)! I usually get one of the big kits from [Evil Mad Scientist](https://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/partsmenu/374), but you can source Sparkfun, Adafruit, SuperBrightLEDs, Ebay, and more for deals. For example:
 - [5mm LED Assorted](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12062) (Sparkfun)
 - [10mm LEDs](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11121) (whatever colors you'd like)
 - [SMD LEDs 3528/1210](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CUGAGE6/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&th=1) (OPTIONAL, but highly recommended - whatever colors you'd like)
- Resistor Kit - should contain many 220 Ohm Resistors (red, red, brown) and 10 K Ohm Resistors (black, brown, orange)(Sparkfun has a [lovely resistor kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10969) that I *highly* recommend
- [3V CR2032 Lithium Batteries](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cr2032+battery&sprefix=CR2032+%2Cgarden%2C151&ref=nb_sb_ss_c_0_7)
- [Coin cell battery holders](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8822) (at least 3)
- [Lithium Ion Battery 3.7 Volts 350 mAh](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2750) (I'd also recommend the [Adafruit Micro Lipo charger](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1304)) *If you decide to buy from another distributor, make sure the LiPo has the regulator circuitry on top - the stuff in the yellow tape*
- Breadboard
- Jumper cables
- Arduino Uno + USB cord (You should be prepared to purchase another microcontroller such as the Adafruit Flora, LilyPad, Gemma MO, Teensy for midterms and/or final projects)
- Lead-free solder
