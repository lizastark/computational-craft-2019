*Materials

This course is heavily based in materials. I will provide samples for you to experiment with, but you will be responsible for purchasing materials for individual projects. For more documentation of conductive/non-conductive materials and tools, check out [How to Get What You Want](http://www.kobakant.at/DIY/?cat=24) and [eTextile Summer Camp](http://etextile-summercamp.org/2016/category/materials/).
