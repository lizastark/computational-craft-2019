# Materials

This course is heavily based in materials. I will provide samples for you to experiment with, but you will be responsible for purchasing materials for individual projects. For more documentation of conductive/non-conductive materials and tools, check out [How to Get What You Want](http://www.kobakant.at/DIY/?cat=24) and [eTextile Summer Camp](http://etextile-summercamp.org/2016/category/materials/).

## [Conductive + Smart Materials Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PHcn2POpbQZtsXZuTycSfywFOW1Vq07Fm5aU_iPH0vY/edit#gid=0)
Please look through the spreadsheet above to familiarize yourself with the materials available to you. It includes:
- conductive and resistive textiles
- conductive and resistive threads
- conductive and resistive yarns
- conductive tapes + adhesives
- conductive and color-changing inks
- shape memory alloys

Some of these are easily obtainable and fairly inexpensive. Others are not. Half the fun of this course is exploring and finding new materials. Test EVERYTHING!!
