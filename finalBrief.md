# Final Brief
The goal of your final project is to show me that you have a grasp of the materials, concepts, skills, and knowledge that we learned over the semester. Other than that, there is no prompt or rule set for the project - it is open. You can do an in depth study of a process or material, create an object, etc. In addition to the project, you must create a tutorial for all or a subset of your project. This can take any form you like - zine, Instructable, book, essay, photo essay, etc. See below for more details. You may combine it with other classes, but you MUST clear it with me first.

You must submit your final project proposal by **MONDAY, DECEMBER 2**. This should include a brief description of what you will do, how you plan to create your tutorial, and any sketches/diagrams.

## Due Wednesday, Dec 11

**1) WORKING PROTOTYPE**

You MUST bring your prototype to show – even if it is not working. If you require a specific environment, please email me.

**2) SHARE OUT**

This is not a formal presentation, but everyone must share out your process and final product. You will have 7 minutes including time for feedback. You should discuss:
- Concept
- Precedents
- Process
- Demo (or video if not working) Challenges you faced
- Future iterations

**3) VIDEO DOCUMENTATION**

You should make a short video introducing your project. It should include the title of your piece, your concept, and a prototype demo.


## DUE TUESDAY, 12/17 AT MIDNIGHT (I will not accept late submissions)
**1) BLOG POST**

Create a short post with: 
- The link to documentation of your tutorial.
- A short description fo the project and its goals/main concept.
- Any other documentation links.
- A short reflection on your process. What were your wins, challenges? What did you learn? Where would you take it next?

**2) TUTORIAL**

The tutorial can take any form - get creative. The goal is to create useful documentation that someone else could use for inspiration or to recreate your project (either as a whole or in part). If your project is complex, you may only do a tutorial for one part of it (e.g. how you built a heating circuit with a particular design) or you may work on explaining one difficult or tricky concept (e.g. voltage dividers). Here are the components you must include:
- Title
- Description. What does it do? Who is it made for? Why did you make it? What motivated it? etc.
- Circuit diagrams. This doesn’t have to be a schematic - it can be a drawing - but it does need to be clear.
- Process diagrams/images of how to make it 
- Materials and tools list
- Images/video (include link if tutorial is a physical object) of final outcome
