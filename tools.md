Add all tools


This course is heavily based in materials. I will provide samples for you to experiment with, but you will be responsible for purchasing materials for individual projects. Look at the materials page for much more.

# REQUIRED
Please purchase the tools, materials, and hardware under "Required" ASAP and bring them to every class.

## TOOLS
- Embroidery needles (like these)
- Scissors
- X-acto Knife
- Paint brushes
- Ruler
- Seam ripper
- Multimeter
- Hot glue gun
- Small needle nose pliers (such as those used for jewelry making like this kit)
- Wire snips
- Wire strippers
- Tweezers
- Alligator clips
- Soldering iron (this can be a cheap iron, nothing fancy like this or even a USB power one like this)
- Straight pins

## MATERIALS
- Paper (range of weights, colors, textures, etc e.g. tracing, vellum, cardstock, etc.)
- Assortment of fabric (muslin or cotton is fine)
- Tape (single, double sided, and/or glue dots)
- Masking tape
- Clear nail polish
- Copper tape (1/8 - 1/4" width with conductive adhesive)
- Heat'N'Bond (you can buy in pairs and split this)
- Fabric glue
- Thread
- Beeswax (for threading conductive thread or you can get a regular needle threader)

## HARDWARE
- A variety of LEDs of your choosing. Keep aesthetics in mind and default to diffused! I usually get one of the big kits from Evil Mad Scientist, but you can source Sparkfun, Adafruit, SuperBrightLEDs, Ebay, and more for deals. For example:
 - 5mm LED Assorted (Sparkfun)
 - 10mm LEDs (whatever colors you'd like)
 - SMT Cool White 5050 LED (I usually get one of the big kits from Evil Mad Scientist)
- Resistors:
 - 220 Ohm Resistors (red, red, brown)
 - 10 K Ohm Resistors (black, brown, orange)
 - Sparkfun has a lovely resistor kit that I *highly* recommend
- 3V CR2032 Lithium Batteries
- Coin cell battery holders (at least 3)
- Breadboard
- Jumper cables
- Arduino Uno + USB cord
- Adafruit Flora or LilyPad (Be prepared to purchase another microcontroller such as the LilyPad, Gemma MO, Teensy for final projects)
- Lead-free solder

# RECOMMENDED

- Snap tool (like this one)
- Knitting needles
- Crochet hooks (also available in Making Center)
- Knitting machine or loom
- Felting needles
- Small loom (weaving)

## MATERIALS
- Metal snaps
- Wool roving
- Metal zippers
- Hook + loop
- Velcro
- Ribbon
- Stuffing
- Polymorph or Sugru

- Small Neodynmium Magnets (you can get these from AI Friedman, the Container Store (look in the office section), or online)

## HARDWARE
- Accelerometer/Compass Sensor
- Flora Color Sensor
- Flora UV Index Sensor
