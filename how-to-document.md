Documentation is a very important part of this course, for a few reasons:

1. This is still an emerging field and, as you will find, there is still a dearth of resources that demonstrate how to contruct or troubleshoot different projects and processes.
2. This is very much an open source community. We all learn from each other’s work, failures and successes alike. Remember: Sharing is caring.
3. As a designer, this is just a good habit to get into, especially since everyone will have to do it for thesis.
4. This is my least favorite reason and incentive to give: If you do not document assignments properly, it will reflect heavily in your final grade.

Documentation can be quick and it will get easier the more you do it. Paragraphs are not required – you may list items. You should spend no more than 20 minutes on it. Documentation for assignments will be checked for grading at midterm and final (in the off chance you miss one :). Documentation for bigger projects (midterm, group presentation, and final) are due the day of presentations.

##Assignments
You can create documentation posts on your personal blog or in a google doc. Include all of the following elements below, then submit a link to your post or doc in the proper Slack channel (e.g. week_1_assignment): 
- Include an image/video of your final product at the top of the post.
- Describe your project briefly. What does it do/How does it work? Is it for a particular audience?
- List the materials used. If they are not in our class resource list, include a link.
- Record any images and/or video that document your process.
- Drawn diagrams of your circuit and data tables (when appropriate). For instance, when we will be measuring resistance of different lengths of thread or time for thermochromic ink to change color.
- Discuss any challenges, frustrations, and successes you encountered.
